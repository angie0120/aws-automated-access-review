"""
AWS Access Review Lambda function for automated security auditing.
This lambda collects security findings from various AWS services and generates a comprehensive
report.

The main workflow:
1. Collect findings from multiple AWS services (IAM, Organizations, Security Hub, etc.)
2. Analyze and compile findings into a structured format
3. Generate a CSV report with detailed findings
4. Create an AI-powered narrative summary using Amazon Bedrock
5. Email the report to specified recipients

This modular architecture allows easy extension with new security checks.

    Main handler for the AWS Access Review Lambda function.

    This is the entry point when the Lambda is triggered either by:
    1. CloudWatch scheduled events (for regular reports)
    2. Manual invocation (for on-demand reports)
    3. CLI testing (via the test_lambda.py script)

    Args:
        event (dict): The event data that triggered this Lambda function
            - Can contain 'force_real_execution' flag for testing
            - Can override recipient_email for testing
        context (LambdaContext): Runtime information provided by AWS Lambda

"""
Module for collecting AWS IAM-related security findings.

This module analyzes AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration to identify
security risks and compliance issues related to users, roles, policies, and credentials.

Key security checks performed:
1. Users with console access but no MFA enabled
2. Access keys older than 90 days
3. Users with administrator privileges
4. Unused IAM roles
5. Weak or missing password policies

Each finding includes:
- Unique identifier
- Severity rating
- Affected resource details
- Description of the issue
- Recommended remediation steps
- Relevant compliance frameworks (CIS, AWS Well-Architected)

    """
    Collect IAM-related security findings from an AWS account.

    This function performs several important security checks on IAM users, roles,
    and account-level settings to identify potential security risks.

    Args:
        iam (boto3.client): A boto3 IAM client with appropriate permissions

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, each representing a security finding with
              standardized fields for severity, description, remediation, etc.

    Security Checks Performed:
        - Users with console access but no MFA (high severity)
        - Users with access keys older than 90 days (medium severity)
        - Users with administrator privileges (medium severity)
        - Unused IAM roles that might increase attack surface (low severity)
        - Weak or missing password policies (medium/high severity)

    Compliance Frameworks:
        - CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
        - AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar
